        [Intro]
    Ayy, give a fuck
    If I die, it's by my way
    I hope this niggas know what's up
    If I fall, let me fall
    If I talk, let me talk
    Let these niggas know
    Let 'em know

    [Verse 1]
    Every night, I get no sleep, counting sheeps
    Trade all my dollar for dreams
    Scared that I might not reap every seed that's deep
    In the earth, might get no trees
    Fear that my girl might leave, like a broken leaf
    I fall till the breeze can sweep
    Fear that the world can see in my ocean deep
    'Cause my mind is broken weak
    I feel stressed, I feel like I'm overdressed
    A guest in this vessel's nest
    And I'm depressed, too pissed to give two shits
    My wrist could be open next
    I possess a will, so I persevere
    To the storm that my soul digest
    And I confess, I hope as I write this verse
    My pen put this mind at rest
    See R&B shows near Glendale
    Get tickets as low as $54
    You might also like
    Take a Bow
    Get Scared
    HOPE

    The Alcott
    The National

    [Chorus]
    Go like hi, hi, bye, bye, but we don't stop
    If your path was full of streams, I guess you swim and don't walk
    I'm all alone all day, I know, I'm on the phone, I feel stuck
    Going ghost, I don't exist, show me the road, I feel lost
    Going ghost, I don't exist, show me the road, I feel lost
    Go like hi, hi, bye, bye, but we don't stop
    If your path was full of streams, I guess you swim and don't walk
    I'm all alone all day, I know, I'm on the phone, I feel stuck
    Going ghost, I don't exist, show me the road, I feel lost

    [Verse 2]
    Wish I was famous and pretty
    Wish they adore, open doors when I touch in the city
    I wish I was happy within me
    I wish I could smile, took a while like when Diddy lost Biggie
    Wish for a healing, I wish for a meaning
    I wish I was dreaming, I wish for a feeling
    Where no more commotion, this ocean of burden, emotion
    I know that I'm tired of swimming
    See, this mic in my hand is mine till I'm sand
    I'll write till I'm right by it
    See, my gesture is grand, what I want, I command
    'Cause my life has been planned by Him
    See, this road full of gold where your soul could be sold
    Name your price and you stand by it
    Know that life is a loan, you alone till you gone
    Take a breath and you light that spliff
    See, this mic in my hand is mine till I'm sand
    I'll write till I'm right by it
    See, my gesture is grand, what I want, I command
    'Cause my life has been planned by Him
    See, this road full of gold where your soul could be sold
    Name your price and you stand by it
    Know that life is a loan, you alone till you gone
    Take a breath and you light that spliff

    [Chorus]
    We go like hi, hi, bye, bye, but we don't stop
    If your path was full of streams, I guess you swim and don't walk
    I'm all alone all day, I know, I'm on the phone, I feel stuck
    Going ghost, I don't exist, show me the road, I feel lost
    Go like hi, hi, bye, bye, but we don't stop
    If your path was full of streams, I guess you swim and don't walk
    I'm all alone all day, I know, I'm on the phone, I feel stuck
    Going ghost, I don't exist, show me the road, I feel lost
