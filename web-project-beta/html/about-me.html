                I am <span class="my-name">Jacob Martinez</span>, a student at UNLV. I am pursuing a degree with a major in Information systems,
                and a minor in Computer Science. My current goal is to find a internship in Software Engineering.<br><br>

                Thanks to my hands on work I believe I am a good candidate. My academic work and personal projects have given me hands on experience in C++, Java, and Web Development.
                My first personal project is this website! I created it from scratch. I learned HTML CSS Javascript using online resources and YouTube guides.
                I enjoy exploring many parts of the technology industry like building computers, creating custom keyboards, and modifying gaming controllers
                and making a small business from that. in the same breath of business, I also run a sticker shop with my girlfriend. At UNLV I have taken
                classes in C++, and Java. Next semester I will be taking an Assembly class.<br><br>

                Outside of school I also work to help support myself and with what time
                I have left I enjoy spending time with friends, playing games, and spending time doing personal projects to grow my technical and problem-solving skills.
